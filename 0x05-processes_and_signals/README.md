# Processes and signals

In this project, I learned what a PID is, what a process is, what a signal is, how to find a process' PID, how to kill a process, and signals that cannot be ignored.

## File Description:
* `0-what-is-my-pid` is a Bash script that displays its own PID.

* `1-list_your_processes` is a Bash Script that displays a list of currently running processes.
