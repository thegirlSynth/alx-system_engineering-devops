# Postmortem: Outage in Web Stack - A Tale of Mischievous Gremlins

## Issue Summary
**Duration:** June 8, 2023, 14:00 UTC to June 9, 2023, 02:00 UTC  
**Impact:** Our web application decided to take a siesta, resulting in intermittent slowdowns and outages that left approximately 25% of our users scratching their heads and wondering if the internet had taken up yoga.

## Root Cause
Let's blame it on the mischievous gremlins! In reality, the root cause of the outage was a pesky database connectivity issue. Our connection pool threw a temper tantrum due to a sudden influx of users, leading to timeouts and connection failures. Apparently, even our servers need a break sometimes!

## Timeline
- **June 8, 2023, 14:00 UTC:** Our monitoring systems went wild, waving their virtual arms and shouting, "Houston, we have a problem!"
- **June 8, 2023, 14:10 UTC:** Our brilliant engineer, who clearly hasn't had enough coffee, noticed that something fishy was going on and decided to investigate.
- **June 8, 2023, 14:30 UTC:** After ruling out network congestion (it wasn't the routers having a tea party), we dove headfirst into the application layer, hoping to catch the gremlins red-handed.
- **June 8, 2023, 15:00 UTC:** The database server raised its hand and said, "Hey, it's getting crowded in here! CPU utilization is skyrocketing, and connections are piling up like dirty laundry."
- **June 8, 2023, 15:30 UTC:** Our team, in a moment of confusion, thought it was the fault of those pesky database queries. We went on a wild goose chase, optimizing queries left and right while the gremlins chuckled in the shadows.
- **June 8, 2023, 18:00 UTC:** With sweat on our brows, we finally realized that the database connection pool was the true culprit, gasping for air under the weight of too many connections. We summoned the mighty development team for reinforcements!
- **June 8, 2023, 19:30 UTC:** The incident escalated to the development team, who arrived with capes and a newfound determination to battle the gremlins.
- **June 8, 2023, 20:00 UTC:** Armed with magical incantations and their wizardry, the developers scaled up the database server and conjured up a new connection pool configuration to tame the mischievous gremlins.
- **June 9, 2023, 02:00 UTC:** Victory! The gremlins retreated, the application regained its composure, and users rejoiced as their online experience returned to normal.

## Root Cause and Resolution
The mischievous gremlins, disguised as an overwhelmed connection pool, caused the outage. To exorcise them, we took the following steps:
- Upgraded the database server's capacity to handle the sudden influx of connections like a boss.
- Cast a powerful spell on the connection pool configuration, optimizing it to efficiently manage connections and prevent future gremlin-inflicted chaos.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
To keep those pesky gremlins at bay and ensure a smooth sailing future, we'll undertake the following measures:
- Enchant the database server with automatic scaling powers to handle traffic surges gracefully.
- Equip our monitoring systems with special gremlin detection goggles, tracking connection pool utilization and performance bottlenecks.
- Organize a Gremlin Olympics, conducting load testing scenarios to ensure our system can withstand the most mischievous gremlin attacks.
- Enlist the help of a gremlin whisperer to review and optimize database query performance, reducing strain on the database server.
- Arrange monthly meetings between the gremlins, operations, and development teams to share lessons learned, create peace treaties, and improve our incident response strategies.

## Tasks to Address the Issue
1. Summon the database server upgrade ritual and upgrade its capacity to handle higher connection loads.
2. Embark on a mystical journey to fine-tune the connection pool configuration, empowering it to resist gremlin temptations.
3. Enlist the assistance of an enchantress or wizard to implement automatic scaling mechanisms for the database server, ensuring it can handle traffic fluctuations with ease.
4. Conjure up a gremlin detection spell within our monitoring systems, adding connection pool metrics and thresholds to our mystical arsenal.
5. Train our developers in the art of gremlin wrestling, conducting load testing scenarios to simulate and analyze the system's behavior during peak traffic.
6. Consult the oracle of query performance analysis to optimize slow-performing queries and alleviate the burden on our database server.
7. Unite the forces of gremlins, operations, and development in post-incident review meetings, where we'll share tales of our battles and devise strategies to conquer future gremlin invasions.

Remember, in the realm of technology, even mischievous gremlins can be tamed with the right spells and a touch of humor. Together, we shall prevail!
